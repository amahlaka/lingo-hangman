üéÆ Game Design Document (GDD)

Title: LingoHangman
Genre: Educational / Word / Puzzle
Platform: Web browser
Target Audience: Language learners and language instructors

‚∏ª

1. Core Concept

A language learning version of Hangman where:
	‚Ä¢	The host inputs words in a Learning Language along with their Native Language translations.
	‚Ä¢	Players guess the word (in the Learning Language) based on the meaning shown (in the Native Language).
	‚Ä¢	The entire game configuration is embedded in a shareable URL, allowing anyone to play the game asynchronously.

‚∏ª

2. Gameplay Flow

Host Mode:
	‚Ä¢	UI to input multiple word pairs:
	‚Ä¢	Format: LearningWord | NativeTranslation
	‚Ä¢	Example: chat | cat
	‚Ä¢	Button to Generate Link:
	‚Ä¢	Encodes word list and configuration in the URL (e.g., via base64 or compressed JSON).
	‚Ä¢	Link can be copied and shared.

Player Mode:
	‚Ä¢	Player opens the link.
	‚Ä¢	Game selects a random word pair.
	‚Ä¢	Displayed elements:
	‚Ä¢	Top: Native Language word (e.g., ‚Äúcat‚Äù)
	‚Ä¢	Hangman drawing area (updated on wrong guesses)
	‚Ä¢	Word to guess (underscores for each letter of Learning Language word)
	‚Ä¢	Wrong guesses (displayed clearly below)
	‚Ä¢	Alphabet letter buttons or keyboard input
	‚Ä¢	Player keeps guessing letters until:
	‚Ä¢	They guess the word correctly (win)
	‚Ä¢	They run out of allowed guesses (lose)
	‚Ä¢	After a round, a Next Word button appears to move to a new random word (if more exist).

‚∏ª

3. Game Rules
	‚Ä¢	Each word must be guessed one letter at a time.
	‚Ä¢	Player has a max of 6‚Äì8 incorrect guesses.
	‚Ä¢	Correct guesses reveal all instances of that letter.
	‚Ä¢	Incorrect guesses are displayed and update the hangman drawing.
	‚Ä¢	Words are pulled randomly and not repeated until all have been played.

5. URL Configuration
	‚Ä¢	Game configuration (word list) is encoded directly in the URL:
	‚Ä¢	Example:

https://lingohangman.com/play#<encoded-config>


	‚Ä¢	Encoded config format:

[
  {"learning": "chat", "native": "cat"},
  {"learning": "chien", "native": "dog"}
]


	‚Ä¢	Compressed and base64-encoded before being placed in the URL hash or query string.

6. Tech Stack
	‚Ä¢	Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
	‚Ä¢	Framework: React (optional), Vanilla JS also viable
	‚Ä¢	Storage: All game state is client-side only
	‚Ä¢	Encoding: Base64 or LZ-string compression for URL-safe payloads

‚∏ª

7. Optional Features (Stretch Goals)
	‚Ä¢	Theme Customization: Light/Dark mode, color schemes
	‚Ä¢	Progress Tracker: How many words guessed correctly
	‚Ä¢	Multilingual Support: UI can be translated
